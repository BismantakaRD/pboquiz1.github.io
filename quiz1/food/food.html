        <p>
          Soto Betawi is one of the most iconic traditional dishes from Jakarta. 
          This hearty soup is known for its rich, creamy broth made from a mixture of coconut milk and cow’s milk, 
          combined with fragrant spices such as lemongrass, galangal, bay leaves, and cinnamon. 
          The broth is typically filled with tender beef or offal, making it both flavorful and comforting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other variations of soto found across Indonesia, Soto Betawi is distinct in its use of creamy soup base. 
          It is usually served with diced potatoes, tomatoes, and emping crackers (melinjo chips), along with a side of steamed rice. 
          To enhance the taste, condiments such as sambal, lime, and sweet soy sauce are often added.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the people of Jakarta, Soto Betawi is more than just a meal, it is a cultural symbol that represents the city’s culinary heritage. 
          The dish reflects Jakarta’s diverse influences, blending traditional flavors with a unique richness that continues to be loved by locals and visitors alike.
